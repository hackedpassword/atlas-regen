# atlas-regen
Attempting to create an Android app for regenerating atlas files.

Commit messages are going to be wild and unruly until this thing actually does something.

Target build to start is my Galaxy S10, Android 12. When working, adding additional compatibility will ensure, up to matching Unciv's compatibility requirements.

Current issue, struggle, is the IDE imploding over build errors somehow introduced that it's lost complete sanity over. Why am I not a software dev again? Oh right. Back into the quicksand...
